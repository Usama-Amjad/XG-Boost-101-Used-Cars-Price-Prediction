# XG-Boost-101-Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
In this project, we train 3 Machine Learning algorithms namely 
Multiple Linear Regression,
Random Forest Regression,
XG-Boost
to predict used cars prices. This project can be used by car dealerships to predict used car prices and understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices.
